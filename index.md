I am an independent researcher and freelance data analyst. I mostly focus on quantitative and population genetics. My CV and contact information can be found on my [site](https://www.bayesicresearch.org/people/).

This page links to documentation for software and libraries I write and maintain.

Documentation is available for the following projects:

 - [MuGen](/MuGen)
 - [align2bed](/align2bed)
 - [sampleSNPs](/sampleSNPs)
