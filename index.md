I am an independent researcher and freelance data analyst. I mostly focus on quantitative and population genetics. My CV and contact information can be found on my [site](https://www.bayesicresearch.org/people/).

This page links to documentation for software and libraries I write and maintain.

I now host all documentation for my software on my [main site](https://www.bayesicresearch.org/software/).

I run [Arch Linux](https://www.archlinux.org/) on my computers. Here are Arch installation instructions for

- [Lenovo ThinkPad X1 Carbon](/ArchLinuxThinkPadX1C4gen.md)
- [Sytem76 OryxPro](/ArchLinuxSys76OP.md)
