I am an independent researcher and freelance data analyst. I mostly focus on quantitative and population genetics. My CV and contact information can be found on my [site](https://www.bayesicresearch.org/people/).

This page links to documentation for software and libraries I write and maintain. It is currently under construction, so please bear with me.

For now, [here](/align2bed) is the basic information on the `align2bed` program
